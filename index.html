    <h1 style="color: white; font-size: 20px;">I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not more so, 
    in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny‚Äôs worth.</h1>

    <p style="color: white;font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6; opacity: 70%;">‚Äú I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I‚Äôve been looking to make a 
    transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up 
    for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. 
    The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing 
    the course, I‚Äôve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ‚Äù

    <h1 style="color: white; font-size: 20px;">team was very supportive and kept me motivated </h1>

    <p style="color: white;font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6; opacity: 70%;">‚Äú I started as a total newbie with virtually no coding skills. I now work as a mobile engineer 
    for a big company. This was one of the best investments I‚Äôve made in myself. ‚Äù</p>

    <h1 style="color: white; font-size: 20px;">Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves. Getting guidance from them and 
    learning from their experiences was easy.</h1>

    <p style="color: white;font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6; opacity: 70%;">‚Äú The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing. The program 
    gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable 
    junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the personal attention you need from 
    an incredible community of smart and amazing people. ‚Äù</p>

  <h1 style="color:  hsl(217, 19%, 35%); font-size: 20px;">Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!</h1>

  <p style="color:  hsl(217, 19%, 35%);font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6; opacity: 70%;">‚Äú Before joining the bootcamp, I‚Äôve never written a line of code. I needed some structure from 
  professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former 
  student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff 
  did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team 
  project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial 
  could ever have. In fact, I‚Äôve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent 
  experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 
  100% recommend! ‚Äù</p>
